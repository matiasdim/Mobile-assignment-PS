# General Notes!

Thanks for your time.
Instructions about the app are on the **Help** section of the app 


## Notes
- I used .xibs files instead of storyboard, because even tho I was coding alone, I am used to avoid storyboards because the cause a lot of issues when 2+ developers, when uploading to git.
- Used struct for the model instead of class since Ido not needed to inherit from any other class
- Good challenge not being able to use third party libs. It is always good for time to time to go back to the basics.

### Possible improvements
- Persist data using core data, realm or something similar instead of using User Defaults
- UI in terms of Design and UX could be improved if it were a real app or a project to be completed on multiple weeks.
